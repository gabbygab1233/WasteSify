 **WasteSify** is a A.I Based Mobile Application that can classify biodegradable and non biodegradable waste in real time. Nonsegregated waste adversely affects human health by giving rise to different infections and diseases. Waste pickers or people living near the area where mixed waste is piled up are at a great risk of such disorders and also reduces the chances of recycling the waste. If the waste is mixed, it cannot undergo the right disposal path. This leads to more landfilling which is a very dangerous way of managing waste. Based on the survey conducted by ( Sudipta Bhawal Mukherji ,Makiko Sekiyama , Takashi Mino, Bharati Chaturvedi. Resident Knowledge and Willingness to Engage in Waste Management in Delhi, India ). **It shows that 60% of residents do not know the difference between biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, and only 2% of them segregate waste**. Fifty-eight percent of respondents reported that the waste collector mixes the segregated waste, 97% of respondents reported that they sold items to an itinerant waste buyer, and 87% of households are covered by doorstep waste collection services. **WasteSify will help people to segregate their waste and differentiate between biodegradable and non-biodegradable.**
